# What can you do here?

Now that you are a part of the UniFOSS network, what can you do?

Since we strongly believe in tinkering, exploration and experimentation, it does not sit right with us to define any kind of bounds for what you can do as a part of UniFOSS.

That said, here are some ideas, put into broad categories for your inspiration.

## Units and SIGs

- Have a look at what various [Units](./organisation-structure.md#unit) and [SIGs](./organisation-structure.md#special-interest-group) are upto and be a part of their activities – it is quite possible that being a part of their activities led you to UniFOSS in the first place.
- [Create your own Unit](./guides/starting-a-unit.md) by teaming up with other members in the UniFOSS community. Almost all the activities we suggest here can be done as a part of an existing Unit, or one that you have created. A Unit can be associated with an existing project, community or movement.
- If you are a part of a FOSS community, you can have your members connect with the wider FOSS community at UniFOSS – just follow the [invitation](./join.md) process.

## Discourse

- Share exciting things you have learnt recently – start a new topic that can give way to thoughtful discussion.
- Conversely, participate in discussion threads. Feel free to ask any questions you may have – we are of the belief that there are no "stupid" questions.
- Create or be a part of an unstructured meetup. This can be virtual or physical, whenever that is possible.
- Pitch a project idea – see if you can get people interested or have it be actionable in some way.

## Talks and Meetups

- Organize a meetup – it can have a theme, or be open to all topics.
- Help other people with their conference talk proposals, or take help from others for your own.
- Let other people know about interesting conferences that they can attend.

## Open Source Projects and Contributions

- Help people contribute to and be a part of Open Source projects, or learn from those who already contribute.
- Create an Open Source project (which would make a Unit, of course) by teaming up with members of the community.

## Networking

- To get a lot of the above activities in motion, you may need to do a fair bit of networking – so feel free to chat and chill with the members of UniFOSS and get to know people in it better.
